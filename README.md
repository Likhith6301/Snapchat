# Snapchat
main.py contains python code which takes picture when we SMILE.
The picture  is saved in the project location. 
We can have multiple cool filters (overlays) on user's face.
The picture is only saved when the user smile's , if the user doesn't smile then the picture will not be saved.
I have shared the overlays and few files which are used and are helpful as well.
